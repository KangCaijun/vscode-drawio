This unofficial extension integrates [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) into VS Code.

## Insiders Build

This is the insider (preview) version of the Julia VS Code extension. Most users should not use this version, but instead install the normal version of the extension. This version of the extension may contain unstable prerelease code.

Please note that you should not have the regular and insider version of the extension installed at the same time.

## Caveats

This extension might get unpublished as soon as the marketplace officially supports beta/nightly/insider builds.
